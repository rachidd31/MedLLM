Here are some commonly used datasets for research in diagnosing diseases from text or symptoms:

---

### **1. Electronic Health Records (EHR) Datasets**
   - **MIMIC-III / MIMIC-IV**:
     - Contains de-identified health records from critical care units.
     - Includes structured data (e.g., lab results) and unstructured data (e.g., clinical notes).
     - Widely used for NLP tasks like disease prediction and symptom extraction.
     - [Access](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/)

   - **eICU Collaborative Research Database**:
     - Focused on intensive care unit patients.
     - Includes clinical notes, physiological data, and treatment records.
     - [Access](https://physionet.org/content/eicu-crd/)

---

### **2. Symptom-Disease Mapping Datasets**
   - **SymCat (Symptom-Catalog)**:
     - A database of symptoms and their associations with diseases.
     - Useful for training models to predict diseases from symptoms.
     - [SymCat](http://www.symcat.com/) (Now partially available through APIs or partnerships).

   - **CDC Wonder**:
     - Aggregates public health data, including disease prevalence and symptoms.
     - [Access](https://wonder.cdc.gov/)

---

### **3. Biomedical Text Corpora**
   - **PubMed and PubMed Central (PMC)**:
     - Large repositories of biomedical literature.
     - Often used for training models like BioBERT.
     - [Access](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)

   - **Clinical Natural Language Processing (cNLP) Datasets**:
     - Examples include i2b2/UTHealth datasets for NLP challenges, such as symptom extraction from clinical notes.
     - Requires permission for access. [i2b2 Dataset Info](https://www.i2b2.org/NLP/)

### **4. Disease-Specific Datasets**
   - **Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset**:
     - A structured dataset with patient symptoms and heart disease diagnoses.
     - Often used for ML applications in diagnostics.
     - [Access](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease)

   - **COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)**:
     - A collection of scholarly articles related to COVID-19, symptoms, and treatments.
     - [Access](https://www.semanticscholar.org/cord19)

---

### **5. Multi-Modal Healthcare Datasets**
   - **PhysioNet Data**:
     - Includes datasets with physiological signals, annotations, and clinical text.
     - [Access](https://physionet.org/)
   
   - **UK Biobank**:
     - Offers rich biomedical data, including symptoms, diagnoses, and medical imaging.
     - [Access](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/)

---

### **6. Open-Source Symptom Checkers**
   - **Infermedica API Dataset**:
     - Includes curated knowledge bases of diseases and symptoms.
     - Access via partnership or API licensing. [Infermedica](https://developer.infermedica.com/)
   
   - **OpenSymptom**:
     - Open dataset mapping symptoms to possible diagnoses.
     - Limited documentation available.

---

### **7. Social Media and Online Health Forums**
   - **MedRed**:
     - Annotated data from online medical forums.
     - Useful for symptom and disease detection from informal text.
   
   - **Reddit Health Forums**:
     - Subreddits like r/AskDocs and r/Health provide large-scale user-generated symptom data.
     - Requires web scraping (ensure ethical and legal compliance).

---

### **8. Medical Ontologies**
   - **SNOMED CT**:
     - Comprehensive clinical terminology system.
     - Maps symptoms to diagnoses and treatments.
     - [Access](https://www.snomed.org/)

   - **ICD-10**:
     - Classification of diseases and health problems.
     - Useful for structured disease-labeling tasks.
     - [Access](https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/classification-of-diseases)

---

### **9. Kaggle Datasets**
   - **COVID-19 Symptoms Dataset**:
     - Includes patient symptom records and disease outcomes.
     - [Access](https://www.kaggle.com/)
   
   - **Disease Symptom Prediction Dataset**:
     - Datasets for ML training on disease prediction based on symptoms.
     - [Example on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kaushil268/disease-prediction-dataset)
